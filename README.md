# Hi

Thank you very much for visiting my GitHub page. Cheers~ 😊😆😎

I'm HONG Anlun(洪安伦) from China. My English name is Allen Hong, which sounds very similar to my Chinese name. 

I'm working for a Chinese chip company which mainly makes industrial cameras. 
I received my M.S. in Network Security at [Tsinghua University, Beijing (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in June 2023 (advised by Prof. [Jilong Wang](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1157/2449.htm)) and B.E. in Computer Science at [Shandong University, Qingdao (SDU)](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in June 2020.
